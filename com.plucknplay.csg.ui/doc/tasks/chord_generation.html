<h1>Generate and Show Chords</h1>
<p>
After all these introductory chapters let us finally come to some interesting calculations - 
which is what the <em>Chord Scale Generator</em> is intended for. 
The most frequent and useful calculation will probably  be the generation of fingerings for a certain chord. 
This function gives the answer to questions like. "Where can I fret a Gsus4?"
</p>

<p>
First you need to switch to the <em>Chords</em> perspective. On the left side, you see the 
<a href="../workbench/views/chord_generation.html">Chord Generation View</a>. 
In this view you can specify the settings for your desired calculation. Beside the chord of interest, 
you can specify a wide range of restrictions to reduce the size of the result set. 
Possible restrictions are for example the level, the grip range or other advanced restrictions like the bass or lead tone. 
Click <em>Calculate</em> in order to start the calculation.

</p>

<p>
The results of the calculation will be displayed in the <a href="../workbench/views/chord_results.html">Chord Results View</a>. 
The generated chords can be arranged in columns. A simple click on the column header starts the rearrangement.
</p>

<p>
Note: Since the result set may be very large, this view is divided into pages for the sake of clarity. 
If many pages exist the current page will be shown in the toolbar on the left side of the actions to turn the pages. 
The arrangement in columns is not restricted to the current page - but takes into consideration the whole result set.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="../workbench/views/chord_results.html">Chord Results View</a> with its textual presentation is a 
somewhat inconvenient representation of generated chords. However, this view simply operates like a "distributing centre" 
where chords can be arranged and selected for further representations in other views.
</p>

<p>
A chord you have selected in the <a href="../workbench/views/chord_results.html">Chord Results View</a> (by selecting 
the corresponding row of the table) will be graphically displayed in other views. 
The <em>Chord Scale Generator</em> provides the following five graphical views to display the selected chord:
</p>

<p>
The <a href="../workbench/views/fretboard.html">Fretboard View</a> shows the selected chord in the context of a whole fretboard. 
Besides, you can choose whether or not the fingering, the notes or the intervals of the selected chord shall be shown.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="../workbench/views/keyboard.html">Keyboard View</a> shows the selected chord on the keyboard of a grand piano. 
Here it is furthermore possible to switch between a notes and an interval mode.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="../workbench/views/box.html">Box View</a> shows the selected chord as a fingering chart or a chord box. 
his is a very common representation, which displays only a small section of the fretboard. 
You can usually find this kind of representation in chord and song books.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="../workbench/views/tab.html">Tab View</a> shows the selected chord in the form of a tablature where each string is assigned to a fret position (if available).
</p>

<p>
The <a href="../workbench/views/notes.html">Notes View</a> shows the selected chord in musical notation (dependent on the chosen clef).
</p>

<p>
    <enablement><not><systemTest property="osgi.os" value="macosx"/></not></enablement>
	<img src="../../images/tasks/chord_generation_02.png" width="781" height="881" alt="Show Chords"/>
</p>
<p>
    <enablement><systemTest property="osgi.os" value="macosx"/></enablement>
	<img src="../../images/tasks/macosx/chord_generation_02.png" width="806" height="884" alt="Show Chords"/>
</p>

<p>
Of course it is up to you which views you consider most helpful and want to use in your arrangement for a corresponding perspective.
