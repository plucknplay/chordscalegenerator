<h1>Find Chords</h1>
<p>
The <em>Chord Scale Generator</em> can do more than generating fingerings for defined chords. 
It is also possible to perform reverse calculations. If you, for example, wonder what chord you have just stumbled on, 
with the <em>Chord Scale Generator</em> you can easily find out.
</p>

<p>
Like you have done for the <a href="chord_generation.html">chord generation</a>, you should use the <em>Chords</em> 
perspective for this calculation. You can arrange the fingering pattern of interest, for instance, in 
the <a href="../workbench/views/box.html">Box View</a>. Unlike the <a href="../workbench/views/fretboard.html">Fretboard</a> 
or <a href="../workbench/views/keyboard.html">Keyboard View</a>, this view is not statical and only displays the results, 
but here you can also switch into a edit/search mode. In the edit/search mode you can arrange own fingering patterns 
and start a reverse calculation to find chords and scales. 
In order to arrange your fingering just double click on the finger position you want to add or remove. 
The results of the reverse calculation will be displayed in the <a href="../workbench/views/chord_results.html">Chord Results View</a> 
as well. You can see in the first table column, which chord or which chords (yes even that is possible) corresponds to 
a fingering pattern.

</p>

<p>
It is also possible to start this reverse calculation in the <a href="../workbench/views/tab.html">Tab View</a>. 
Here you can arrange (also in the edit/search mode) your fingering pattern in a more simple graphical representation.
</p>

<p>
For all of you who are well familiar with musical notations there is one more special feature. 
In the <a href="../workbench/views/notes.html">Notes View</a> it is possible to find chords based on musical notation. 
Thus, you can find all possible fingerings for a musical notation of a chord.
You can also see in the first table column of the <a href="../workbench/views/chord_results.html">Chord Results View</a> 
to which chord a single fingering corresponds.
</p>

<p>
    <enablement><not><systemTest property="osgi.os" value="macosx"/></not></enablement>

</p>

<p>
Note: If it was not possible to determine a chord for a fingering or musical notation it does not necessarily mean 
that there is no chord available or that the fingering is invalid. The chord, which corresponds to your fingering, 
is just not contained in your defined chord list.<br/>
Note: The <em>Chord Scale Generator</em> performs all calculations only on the basis of the defined data (chord and scale definitions).
</p>

<p>
Note: As long as the view is in the edit/search mode, it is blocked and newly selected chord will not be displayed.
