<h1>Manage your Chords and Scales</h1>
<p>
Before we finally start with some calculations let us first have a look at the data which is needed for the 
calculation. The <em>Chord Scale Generator</em> is all about chords and scales - therefore it's essential to 
define them in some place. You can see in the corresponding views <a href="../workbench/views/chords.html">Chords</a> 
and <a href="../workbench/views/scales.html">Scales</a> which chords and scales are defined in your application. 
These two views are structured analogously to the <a href="../workbench/views/instruments.html">Instruments View</a> 
and are used to manage your chords and scales.
</p>

<p>
The most common chords and scales are pre-defined. 
Of course, you can define new chords and scales, as well as change existing ones or even delete them.
</p>

<p>
Note: Especially for reverse calculations (<a href="find_chords.html">Find Chords</a>/ <a href="find_scales.html">Find Scales</a>) 
it is recommendable to provide a certain amount of chords and scales. 
If you only define the chords and scales you usually use (e.g. your standard song chords and two pentatonic scales) 
the reverse calculations will probably fail in many cases.

<p>
The corresponding editors (see <a href="../workbench/editors/chord.html">Chord</a> and <a href="../workbench/editors/scale.html">Scale Editor</a>) 
are very similar in their structure. You can use them to specify the name and the defining intervals, 
as well as comments and "aka"-names. Aka means "also known as". This option takes into consideration that most of the chords 
(and even some scales) have several different synonyms and different notations respectively. 
With the help of the aka names you do not have to define a separate chord (or scale) for each of the synonyms. 
</p>

<p>
These additionally defined names can also help if you want to find a chord or a scale. 
The global action <a href="../workbench/menu/extras.html#ExtrasMenu_OpenChord">Extras &#8594; Open Chord...</a><a href="../workbench/menu/extras.html#ExtrasMenu_OpenScale">/Scale...</a> 
considers all defined names (including the aka names) of your chords and scales. So, before you want to add a 
supposingly missing chord, first make sure whether or not this chord already exists under a different main name 
and the name you know is defined as "aka"-name.
