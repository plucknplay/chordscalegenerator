<h1>Manage your Instruments</h1>
<p>
After you have learned about the main concepts of the <em>Chord Scale Generator</em>, 
we now want to introduce you to some concrete functions of this program. 
Let us start with the management of your instruments since, first of all, 
the <em>Chord Scale Generator</em> has to know on which instrument the calculations shall be performed.
</p>

<p>
In order to manage your instruments, first switch to the <em>Setup</em> perspective. On the left side, 
you see the <a href="../workbench/views/instruments.html">Instruments View</a> where you can manage your 
instruments. The <a href="../workbench/views/instruments.html">Instruments View</a> 
operates similar to a file explorer - you can organize existing instruments in categories, as well as copy, 
delete or rename selected elements. Besides, it is possible to create new instruments or edit existing ones. 
By double-clicking on them, the corresponding <a href="../workbench/editors/instrument.html">editor</a> opens 
where you can define your instrument in detail.

<p>
The <em>Chord Scale Generator</em> enables you to define all stringed instruments (we know of) - 
from guitars, basses or ukuleles up to more exotic instruments like balalaikas, bouzoukis, domras or charangos. 
As long as your instrument has between two and twelve strings the <em>Chord Scale Generator</em> will support it. 
You can specify the name, the dimensions (string and fret number) and the tuning of the instrument, 
as well as more advanced settings like the sound, the scale length or even the positions of the capo (tasto). 
The significance of each available setting is explained in the corresponding help contents of this editor.
</p>

<p>
But don't worry! You probably won't have to define all your instruments manually. 
Many instruments are already pre-defined in the <em>Chord Scale Generator</em>. 
Besides, there are several files enclosed where all instruments we know and their most common tunings are defined. 
You can easily import these files and extend your instruments list.
</p>

<p>
Since the <em>Chord Scale Generator</em> needs to know on which instrument the calculations shall be performed 
you have to set one of the defined instruments active. In order to activate an instrument you simply have 
to select the desired instrument in the <a href="../workbench/views/instruments.html">Instruments View</a> and 
perform the popup menu entry <a href="../workbench/views/instruments.html#instruments_view_popup_menu_set_active">Set Active</a>. 
The active instrument will get a special icon in the <a href="../workbench/views/instruments.html">Instruments View</a> 
and will also be displayed in the bottom-right corner in the <a href="../workbench/status_bar.html">status bar</a>.
