<h1>Versions</h1>

<p>
You are allowed to use the test version of the <em>Chord Scale Generator</em> as long as you want. 
This gives you enough time to properly test the <em>Chord Scale Generator</em> before you consider to 
buy the full version.
</p>

<p>
The test version offers almost the whole range of operations. You are allowed to perform all 
calculations on any instrument and it is also possible to export the results in order to create 
your own chord, scale or song books.
</p>

<p>
However, the number of the predefined chords and scales is, of course, limited in the test version. 
There is only a limited number of chords and scales available and it is not possible to edit them 
or even create new chords or scales. Therefore, you can only perform the calculations on a certain 
number of chords and scales.
</p>

<p>
<span class="note">Note:</span> With these restrictions, you may sometimes find the results unsatisfactory, 
especially the reverse calculations in order to find corresponding chords or scales for a given fingering 
pattern or musical notation This is due to the fact that the program can only work with chords and scales 
which are already defined.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, we hope you are able to properly test the <em>Chord Scale Generator</em> and you will get 
a first insight into the range of useful operations that this program offers you. If you decide to 
purchase this software you will need an activation key, which you can buy on our 
<a href="http://www.pluck-n-play.com/en/buy.html" target="_blank">website</a>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="note">Note:</span> In order to activate the <em>Chord Scale Generator</em> on the computer you want to use it on, you 
need to have internet access for a short time.
